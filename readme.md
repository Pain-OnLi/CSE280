# SOPHOMORE PROJECT

### Getting Started with Git and Github.

Since you may not be familiar with using git from the command line, we will use
GitHub's desktop application to make things much easier.

1. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

2. Create a GitHub account if you do not have one.

3. Fork my CSE280 repository. (Top right of this page)

4. Open GitHub Desktop, sign in, and click the "+" on the top left. Select "Clone"
and then select the CSE280 repository you forked from me.

5.
